# nodeFlashcard

A flashcard type app using nodeJS, expressJS, mongoose, ejs and bootstrap

At first you'll be greeted with a login page, either login or create a new profile. Then you will be directed to your profile where your decks are (if new profile, then default starter deck). From here, you can add/delete/share/view decks. Clicking on deck name takes you to the deck where you see the cards. You can add, delete, edit cards and also edit the deck name from here. When a deck is shared, it will be shown on the community page, here, any shared deck is viewable by every user and is able to be downloaded by other users. Downloaded decks will be added to your decks. You can filter through shared decks by creator name or deck name. Searching empty removes all filters. On the learn page, you select one of your decks and the number of cards you want to quiz yourself on. These cards will be randomly generated. You'll be given the front card and you'll have to guess the back.
